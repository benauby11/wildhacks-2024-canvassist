It's a 25-page handout given the configuration steps, but a large part of the handout is screenshots. Note that Amazon details change all the time, so the screenshots you see may not match the handout exactly --- please let us know if there are any significant differences or steps where you aren't sure what to do.\nPart 02 is now released... Part 01 had you configure RDS and S3 in AWS, i.e. configure our server-side. In Part 02 we focus on the client-side, building a Python client to interact with RDS and S3 using Amazon's boto library. Details for part 02 in this handout.\nParts 01 and 02 are due Wednesday April 10th, with late submissions accepted no later than Friday April 12th.\u00a0",
